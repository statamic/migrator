My name is Niles Peppertrout. I am a relatively new Park Ranger working at Redwood Nation Park with a background in Applied Harry Potter Sciences from [Frostburg University](http://frostburg.edu). I've always loved the outdoors but never dreamed I'd get paid to wander them. [Join me on my adventure](/blog)!
